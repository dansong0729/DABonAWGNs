# DAB-for-AWGN-channels
## Amplitude Constrained
run the script "Demo_DAB_AC_AWGN.m" in the folder "Amplitude Constrained" to see the DAB algorithm in action. Figures will show the live status of the DAB algorithm being applied for various SNRs. 

## Power Constrained
run the script "Demo_DAB_PC_AWGN.m" in the folder "Power Constrained" to see the DAB algorithm in action. Figures will show the live status of the DAB algorithm being applied for various SNRs, with different predefined input cardinalities.
